## Personal interpretation of Parallelism
In psychology parallelism refers to the theory that human mind and body co-exist in a pre-established state of harmony (created by God). Which means they're perfectly coordinated but they do not interact casually with each other. It implies that mind and body do not work in a cause-effect basis. These two operate on parallel lines, working independently but inseparably. 
In my opinion parallelism fails to verify several scientific questions because if mind and body had no relation and were independent then human wouldn't be any different from robots. If we use the theory of electrons as our proof of the existence then a scientist can manipulate the electrons that connect through our mind and body and extract the mind and put into someone’s body. The body must have a special code or something special to connect with the mind. We can’t just move the mind into someone’s body to survive.
So outside of thesis, parallelism has no real meaning. It was a way for people back in Age of Reason to reconcile their belief in God. 


## Pong inspired by Parallelism 
I attempted to apply my interpretation of "parallelism" to modify the rules of the classic game "Pong"

### New rules
- A pong game's basic requirements are simple- two paddles and one moving ball, which stays the same. However what if we had more than 2 paddles?  i added one more paddle for each player, which gives us 4 paddles in total.
- the ball will be moving as usual. But each player will have two paddles- one that he will control (using W/S and up arrow/down arrow respectively for each players) and another one that will actually hit and bounce the ball.
- the paddle that the players will control will be bright and visible but the one that will actually hit the ball will be hard to notice. And the catch is, the later paddle will move much slower compared to the one the player actually controls.
- because of this, it's not just enough that the player moves the visible paddle fast enough to catch the ball but he has to make sure that he is timing it properly for the ball to hit the hard-to-see paddle that's actually gonna bounce it back.

### How it’s related to Parallelism
- I think players always have the freedom to interpret how they want to but from my point of view, my starting point was ‘separating mind and body’ because that’s the core essense of parallelism.
- Naturally, the two paddles for each players symbolize body and mind respectively- the bright visible one that the player controls is body and the almost invisible one that bounces the ball back is supposed to be the mind.
- Here the mind and body work independently- both at their own speed and they never interact but also together, as they’re gonna move in the same direction always. But parallelism implies body is an extended thing- which is why here the paddle that represents body doesn’t actually perform the main interaction (bouncing the ball) but instead in a shell that merely obeys what the player instructs it to.
