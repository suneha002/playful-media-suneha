## Day 1 assignment
- the emotion i was assigned was 'wonder'. first i started with shapes and the obvious answer was to use circles, soft circles specifically.
- i also realized that people can think of "Wonder" in more than just one way. for some of them it's a good thing and for some of them it's something out of world.
- so after thinking that through i decided to go with a more "Dreamy" color palette. hence the use of yellows and pinks and purples. i initially wanted to add a gradient effect to make the code shorter but for first day's practice's sake i decided to take a challenge and draw repetitive circles instead.

## Day 2 assignment
- the emotion change i was given was "Wonder to courage"
- i thought of it as a little challenging first because even though one can surely pull it off purely from visual sense, if we were to think of this emotion development from realistic point of view the possibilities were very few.
- so the story i thought of in the end goes like this >> the same sentiment from last day stays. yellow-pink color palette and circles to give it a dreamy feeling. now for the emotion development i tried to show the middle circle as an entity from whom the other smaller circles go further and further. and then the middle circle grows bigger. and this goes on in a loop 
- this implies that despite its other companions going away and leaving it alone, the middle entity grows courage and keeps growing.



## Day 3 assignment

##### pattern using shapes
- i started this assignment without very detailed plan as i wanted to experiment how far only shapes will take me. I wanted to add different sizes of rectangles, change angle and then make diamonds. i chose a autumn-ish palette which doesn't have much deep reason behind it except thats the color of clothes i was wearing today and i really liked it cuz my shirt also had lots of rectangles and diamond shapes.

##### pattern using image
- i have a huge love for tiles. at my home we have this specific kind of tiles in the bathroom that has 6 tiles within it which are random and sometimes, when joined together they even match and create a new pattern together.
- that was the main inspiration behind this assignment. i tried to recreate those tiles. thus i made 4 images that had 4 tiles in them each. and some of them, if placed beside each other will join and create a new pattern.

## Day 4 assignment
- since the asset i chose for this assigment was already as existing file there wasn't any creative thoughts behind the design of the charater. however i experimented with assigning different keys commands and next i'd like to make my own sprites and different even more different kind of actions in it.


## Day 5 assignment
- this 30-ish second interaction was inspired from a mixture of different things i love- quiet beaches and cats and children's magical stories.
##### Interaction 
- the player goes to a beach on search of freedom. a lonely beach with silent waves hitting the shore that will make anyone feel like they're the only person in the world- that's the kind of setting i wanted to give this project.
- after that the player collects items that come washing away in the sea waves and soon a strange looking fairy. after the player helps the fairy, it grants them their wish to be free.
- the player finally gains wings and flies away in the sky, looking over the beach as they have finally gained freedom
##### Story
- the story can be interpreted in many different ways. but for me it's about someone, who is tired of their adult life filled with responsibilities, reinventing childhood joys and finding freedom away from all the stressful events. however what they consider "freedom" can vary depending on each person and thus the story can have many vastly different interpretations. I'd like to leave the conclusion to whoever is playing it
##### Work process
- i had previously coded a visual novel-ish structure in unity before using class to change scenes, interactions so i tried to implement similar things in p5 js as well which was a little challenging as p5 is not exactly designed for making "games" but it was enjoyable and a nice experience regardless.
- if i had to name inspirations for this work, im hugely inspired by vivinos and vewn's works. overall i wanted the background to look dull and the fairy to look more vibrant to create a sense of stark difference.
- however i'd like to change and modify quite a lot places (like adding music, animation to the text) to make it look more immersive and just pleasant to look at
